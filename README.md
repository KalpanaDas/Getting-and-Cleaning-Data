# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This is a Coursera course project where I am going to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This repository is a Kalpana Das submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The dataset used here is - Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.

The data used for this project can be found at the below link. https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The original description of the dataset can be found at the below link. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Files - 
1. README.md Explains the analysis files are clear and understandable.
2. CodeBook.md Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
3. run_analysis.R Does the data preparation and 
   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and           each subject.
